Underwater Force Plate 

Hello all! 

Welcome to the DIY Underwater Force plate

In order to create your own force plate we will be using different plateforms and integrating them to gather small forces underwater(can detect .5grams)! 

Fusion 360 to design the force sensors!

Matlab to gather data from a NIDAQ that gathers an anolog input from an INA 125P amplifier and Load cell

Python to create a calibration matrice

EAGLE CAD to generate our circuit (if you want to edit and personalize to your likings)
