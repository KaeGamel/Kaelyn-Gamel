Underwater Force Plate 

Hello all! 

Welcome to the DIY Underwater/Terrestrial Force plate! 

In order to create your own force plate we will be using different platforms and integrating them to gather small forces terrestrially or underwater(can detect .5grams)!

I would start with the files parts and programs needed. I also have attached a word doc that allows you to click on the links for most of the parts to purchase.

Fusion 360 to design the force sensors, Formlab to 3D print.

Matlab to gather data from a NIDAQ that gathers an anolog input from an INA 125P amplifier and Load cell.

EAGLE CAD to generate our circuit (if you want to edit and personalize to your likings)

Most importantly the checklist needed to integrate everything!
